# Configurations

Ambient Sounds Tuner supports various configurations. They are saved in
`AmbientSoundsTuner.xml` in the
local mod folder. On Windows, this is
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\AmbientSoundsTuner`.

## State
These settings are found in the `State` tree. Please do not change any of these,
unless you know what you're doing. I'm not responsible if you broke your game.

## Volume settings
Currently, there are 5 different categories where various volume settings are
saved. These are: `AmbientVolumes`, `AnimalVolumes`, `BuildingVolumes`,
`VehicleVolumes` and `MiscVolumes`. Each category has its own set of keys and
values. Please be careful should you decide to change these settings manually.

## Other settings
These settings are not contained within a specific tree. *Italic values* are the
default values.
